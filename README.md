# StudentCaptureSystem

This menu-driven text-based application can:
1. generate a student ID based on a student’s full name
2. capture (record) marks for multiple students
3. draw a simple bar chart of a student’s highest and lowest marks 5
4. print a table of student IDs and corresponding average (mean) mark.

This program was done in Java when I was learning object-oriented programming. It also has test files.
